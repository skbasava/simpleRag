    Give me MPU policy details for address 0x0EF01000 in KAANAPALLI version 5.3
  sql_context:
    - project: KAANAPALLI
      version: 5.3
      mpu_name: AOSS_PERIPH_MPU_XPU4
      rg_index: 35
      addr_start: 0x0EF01000
      addr_end: 0x0EF02000
      region_size: 4096
      covers_address: true
  answer: |
    Address 0x0EF01000 is covered by MPU region AOSS_PERIPH_MPU_XPU4
    with address range 0x0EF01000–0x0EF02000.
    This region was selected because it is the smallest matching region
    (most specific) and has the highest priority (rg_index 35).

    Which MPU policy applies between 0x0EF00000 and 0x0EF02000 in KAANAPALLI?
  sql_context:
    - mpu_name: AOSS_PERIPH_MPU_XPU4
      addr_start: 0x0EF01000
      addr_end: 0x0EF02000
      effective_overlap_size: 4096
      rg_index: 35
  answer: |
    The address range overlaps MPU region AOSS_PERIPH_MPU_XPU4.
    This region was chosen because it has the largest effective overlap
    with the queried range and the highest priority.

      profile: TZ
      addr_start: 0x0EF01000
      addr_end: 0x0EF02000
  answer: |
    MPU AOSS_PERIPH_MPU_XPU4 defines access control for the address
    range 0x0EF01000–0x0EF02000 under the TZ profile.
    This MPU region enforces security boundaries for the subsystem.

  sql_context:
    - project: KAANAPALLI
      version: 5.3
      is_latest: true
  answer: |
    No version was specified, so the latest available version (5.3)
    for project KAANAPALLI was used to determine the MPU policy.

  sql_context:
    - mpu_name: AOSS_DYNAMIC_MPU
      addr_start: 0xFFFFFFFF
      addr_end: 0xFFFFFFFF
      profile: NON_STATIC
  answer: |
    This MPU region is dynamic and programmed by software at runtime.
    The address range is not statically defined in hardware.

    Explain MPU region with address 0xFFFFFFFF in KAANAPALLI
  sql_context:
    - addr_start: 0xFFFFFFFF
      addr_end: 0xFFFFFFFF
      profile: TZ
  answer: |
    This MPU region is unused because both start and end addresses
    are set to 0xFFFFFFFF and the region is not marked as dynamic.

    Give me MPU policy for address 0x0EF01000 across all projects
  sql_context:
    - project: KAANAPALLI
      version: 5.3
      covers_address: true
    - project: HAWI
      version: 4.1
      covers_address: true
  answer: |
    The address 0x0EF01000 is covered in multiple projects.
    The results show MPU regions from KAANAPALLI and HAWI,
    each enforcing its own project-specific policy.

  description: Multiple regions match, potential conflict
  user_query: |
    Is there any conflict for address 0x0EF01000 in KAANAPALLI?
  sql_context:
    - mpu_name: MPU_A
      rg_index: 10
      region_size: 8192
    - mpu_name: MPU_B
      rg_index: 35
      region_size: 4096
  answer: |
    Multiple MPU regions cover the address.
    MPU_B was selected because it is more specific (smaller region)
    and has higher priority. No effective conflict exists.
